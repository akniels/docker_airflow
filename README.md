# docker_airflow

I am currently in the process or learning airflow and docker. This repository shows a docker implementation of and instance of airflow with created dags and tasks. The tasks and dags created follow what is taught in the udemy class [A Complete Hands-On introduction to Apache Airflow](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-hands-on-course-to-master-apache-airflow/). This is a work in progess and have not completed all the dags in the udemy course. End state will include other dags for kaggle datasets and data modeling.
